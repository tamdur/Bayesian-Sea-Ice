# Baysian-Sea-Ice

A Bayesian prediction model for summer sea ice extent in the Arctic.

## Description

We add to the existing body of literature attempting to reduce the uncertainty in the timing of a seasonally ice free Arctic by implementing a novel Bayesian statistical modelling approach. Our model accurately predicts outcomes through the 21st century based on only the first 42 data points, corresponding to the observational time interval from 1979--2020. See Henke et al. 2022 for more information.
